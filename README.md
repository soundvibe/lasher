Lasher is an embeddable key-value store written in Java.

What is Lasher?
-------------------
Lasher is very lightweight (has no dependencies) embeddable persistent key-value store with very fast performance. 
Lasher incrementally rehashes stripes when needed, avoiding full table rehash which is typical for standard hash tables.
This helps to sustain high performance even when the number of elements in the table is very large.  

It is possible to store millions of elements in Lasher and use very little memory because all the data is persisted into memory mapped files.

Lasher could be used instead of any regular in-memory hashmap without any performance decrease. 
It is even faster than `ConcurrentHasMap<K,V>` in our benchmarks and uses much less memory. 

Lasher stores consist of 2 binary files - index and data.

LasherMap
-------------------
LasherMap implements `ConcurrentMap<K,V>` for easier interoperability with java maps.

TimeLash
-------------------
TimeLash is a time-series map backed by Lasher where data is partitioned by time intervals.
It supports very efficient data retention strategies.    
To put or get values from the map, timestamp should be additionally provided, e.g.:

```java
try (var timeLash = new TimeLash<>(
    dir, //db directory
    Duration.ofHours(6), //data retention duration 
    Serdes.STRING, //key serde
    Serdes.STRING)) // value serde {
    timeLash.put("foo", "bar", Instant.now()); 
    var bar = timeLash.get("foo", Instant.now()); 
}
```

Artifacts 

Lasher is available on Maven Central, hence just add the following dependency:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>net.soundvibe</groupId>
    <artifactId>lasher</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```
Scala SBT
```
libraryDependencies += "net.soundvibe" % "lasher" % "0.0.1"
```
